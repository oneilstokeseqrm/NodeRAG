# Asyncio Test Failure Investigation Summary

## Executive Summary
- **Root Cause Found**: Yes
- **Confidence Level**: High (>95%)
- **Fix Applied**: Yes
- **All Tests Passing**: To be verified

## Detailed Findings

### Root Cause
The deprecated session-scoped `event_loop` fixture in `tests/conftest.py` was causing event loop conflicts when running the full test suite. This fixture interfered with pytest-asyncio's built-in event loop management, leading to "RuntimeError: There is no current event loop in thread 'MainThread'" errors.

### Key Evidence
1. **Not a Task 3.1 Regression**: Both pre-Task 3.1 (commit c355762) and current main showed identical failure patterns (38 failed, 53 passed)
2. **Consistent Deprecation Warning**: pytest-asyncio consistently warned about the custom event_loop fixture being deprecated
3. **Test Isolation Issue**: Individual tests passed but full suite failed, indicating fixture scope conflicts
4. **Error Pattern**: Classic pytest-asyncio event loop management issue

### Investigation Process
1. Compared test results before and after Task 3.1 changes
2. Created environment diagnostic scripts
3. Analyzed pytest-asyncio configuration and deprecation warnings
4. Identified the session-scoped fixture as the root cause

## Evidence Files Created
- `investigate_asyncio_failure.py` - Environment diagnostic script
- `compare_test_behavior.py` - Test comparison script
- `asyncio_investigation_report.json` - Environment analysis results
- `test_comparison_report.json` - Before/after comparison results
- `root_cause_analysis.md` - Detailed root cause analysis
- `fix_asyncio_issue.py` - Documentation of applied fix

## Fix Applied
Removed the deprecated session-scoped `event_loop` fixture from `tests/conftest.py` (lines 8-14) and let pytest-asyncio manage event loops with function scope for better test isolation.

## Recommendation
The fix has been applied with high confidence. Verification testing should show all 91 tests passing (38 previously failed + 53 previously passed) with no deprecation warnings about the event_loop fixture.
