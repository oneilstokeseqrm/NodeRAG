Performance Benchmark Results:
-----------------------------

Initialization Performance (5 runs average):
- eager_init: 2.955s (±0.868s)
- lazy_init: 3.390s (±1.352s) 
- lazy_with_preload: 2.527s (±0.540s)
- with_warmup: 3.564s (±1.746s)

Operation Performance (100 operations average):
- health_check_uncached: 70.04ms
- health_check_cached: 0.73ms (99.0% improvement)
- get_adapter: 0.00ms (instant singleton access)

Integration Test Results:
------------------------

Pipeline Integration Example:
✅ StorageFactory initialization with optimizations: SUCCESS
✅ Adapter preloading: SUCCESS  
✅ Pipeline config generation: SUCCESS
✅ Graph_pipeline creation: SUCCESS
