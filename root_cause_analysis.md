# Asyncio Test Failure Root Cause Analysis

## Failing Test Pattern
- **Test Pattern**: 38 failed, 53 passed (consistent across commits)
- **Error Type**: RuntimeError: There is no current event loop in thread 'MainThread'
- **Error Context**: Multiple async tests fail when run in full suite but pass individually

## Investigation Results

### 1. Environment Analysis
- Python 3.12.8 with pytest-asyncio installed
- Deprecated session-scoped event_loop fixture in tests/conftest.py
- Consistent deprecation warning about custom event_loop fixture

### 2. Test Comparison
- **Pre-Task 3.1 (c355762)**: 38 failed, 53 passed
- **Current main**: 38 failed, 53 passed
- **Regression**: NO - identical failure patterns confirm this is NOT a Task 3.1 regression

### 3. Code Analysis
The deprecated session-scoped event_loop fixture in tests/conftest.py conflicts with pytest-asyncio's built-in event loop management, causing event loop isolation issues between tests.

## Root Cause Determination

### Primary Hypothesis: Deprecated Session-Scoped Event Loop Fixture
- **Evidence**: 
  - Consistent deprecation warning in pytest output
  - Session-scoped fixture causes event loop conflicts between tests
  - Individual tests pass but full suite fails (classic fixture scope issue)
  - pytest-asyncio documentation recommends removing custom event_loop fixtures
- **Confidence**: HIGH (>95%)

### Supporting Evidence
- Both commits show identical failure patterns (rules out Task 3.1 regression)
- Deprecation warning specifically mentions the custom event_loop fixture
- Error pattern matches known pytest-asyncio fixture conflicts
- Individual test success indicates code is correct, fixture scope is the issue

## Recommended Fix

Remove the deprecated session-scoped event_loop fixture from tests/conftest.py and let pytest-asyncio manage event loops with function scope for better test isolation.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Removed lines 8-14 containing the deprecated event_loop fixture
- Kept pytest-asyncio configuration in pytest_configure function
- This allows pytest-asyncio to use its built-in function-scoped event loop management

## Expected Outcome
All 91 tests should pass (38 previously failed + 53 previously passed) with no deprecation warnings.
