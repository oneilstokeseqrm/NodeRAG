Yes, we do have automated reporting features. What type of reports are you looking to automate?\n\n[09:46] Customer: We need weekly sales summaries and monthly performance dashboards sent to our branch manager automatically.\n\n[09:47] Agent Lisa: That's definitely possible with our premium reporting add-on. It allows you to schedule reports and set up email distribution lists. Would you like me to check if this is included in your current plan?\n\n[09:48] Customer: Yes, please check. We're on the enterprise plan.\n\n[09:49] Agent Lisa: I see you have the standard enterprise plan. The automated reporting feature is available as an add-on for $200/month. It includes unlimited scheduled reports and up to 20 email recipients per report.\n\n[09:50] Customer: That sounds reasonable. Can you send me more details about the setup process?\n\n[09:50] Agent Lisa: Absolutely! I'll email you a feature overview and setup guide. Would you like me to schedule a demo call to walk through the configuration?\n\n[09:51] Customer: Yes, that would be helpful. How about next Tuesday afternoon?\n\n[09:51] Agent Lisa: Perfect! I'll send you a calendar invite for Tuesday at 2 PM. Is there anything else I can help you with today?\n\n[09:52] Customer: No, that covers everything. Thanks for your help!",
