I'm sorry to hear about the connection issues. Let me help you troubleshoot this. Can you tell me which browser you're using?\n\n[14:31] Customer: I'm using Chrome, version 120.0.6099.109\n\n[14:32] Agent Mike: Thanks. Can you try clearing your browser cache and cookies for our domain? Also, please check if you can access the dashboard from an incognito window.\n\n[14:35] Customer: I tried incognito and it works! The dashboard loads fine there.\n\n[14:35] Agent Mike: Great! That confirms it's a cache issue. After clearing your cache in the regular browser, you should be able to access it normally. Is there anything else I can help you with today?\n\n[14:36] Customer: No, that fixed it. Thank you for the quick help!\n\n[14:36] Agent Mike: You're welcome! Have a great day!",
