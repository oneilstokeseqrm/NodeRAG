  "text": "Subject: Invoice Discrepancy - Account #12345\n\nDear Support Team,\n\nI noticed a discrepancy in our latest invoice dated January 10, 2024. The amount charged for our premium service package appears to be $150 higher than our agreed contract rate of $2,500 per month. Could you please review this and provide clarification?\n\nOur account manager mentioned there might have been a billing system update that affected some accounts. I'd appreciate a prompt resolution as this impacts our monthly budget reconciliation.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn Smith\nFinance Director\nACME Corporation",
