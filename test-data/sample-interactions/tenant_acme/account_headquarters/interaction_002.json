How can I help you today?\n\nCustomer: Hi Sarah, I'm calling about our software license renewal. We received a notification that our enterprise license expires next month, but I thought we had auto-renewal enabled.\n\nAgent: Let me check your account details. I can see here that auto-renewal was disabled last quarter due to a payment method update. Would you like me to re-enable it?\n\nCustomer: Yes, please. And can you confirm the renewal rate? We want to make sure there are no surprise price increases.\n\nAgent: Absolutely. Your current rate is locked in at $5,000 annually for the next two years. I'm enabling auto-renewal now and you'll receive a confirmation email within 24 hours.\n\nCustomer: Perfect, thank you for your help!\n\nCall duration: 8 minutes 32 seconds",
