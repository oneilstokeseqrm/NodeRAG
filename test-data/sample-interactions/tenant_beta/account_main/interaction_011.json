Bi-directional data sync between your platform and Salesforce\n2. Real-time customer interaction logging\n3. Automated lead scoring based on interaction data\n4. Custom field mapping for our unique business processes\n\nQuestions:\n- Do you have pre-built Salesforce connectors?\n- What is the typical implementation timeline?\n- Are there any additional licensing costs for API access?\n- Can you provide technical documentation for the integration?\n\nWe're looking to complete this integration by the end of Q1 2024.
