            <p>The document pipeline focuses on text splitting and metadata propagation.</p>
            <p>LLM operations occur in downstream components like entity extraction and summarization.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Text Splitting Operations</h2>
        <p>Text splitting was performed using the configured SemanticTextSplitter.</p>

        <h2>Metadata Propagation</h2>
        <p>Metadata was successfully propagated from interaction payload to all text chunks.</p>
